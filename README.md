# S.O.L.I.D. First 5 principles of class design


## SRP The single responsibility principle
A class should only have a single responsibility.
A class should only have one, and only one,  reason to change.

## OCP The open closed principle
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. You should be 
able to extend a class without modifying it.

## LSP The liskov substitution principle
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

## ISP The interface segregation principle
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

## DIP The dependency inversion principle
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
